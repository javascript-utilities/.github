# JavaScript Utilities


This GitHub organization is dedicated to building JavaScript tools for static web sites, such as those hosted by GitHub Pages. Other than the `.github` repository all others maintained by this Organization _should_ be able to be included within other GitHub projects as a `submodule`.
